# ebisuzaki
This function generates random phase surrogate time series using the Ebisuzaki's random phase method (Ebisuzaki, 1997) in either R or Python. The function requires the installation of the package 'signal' to perform the inverse FFT. This function is useful for performing a significance test in serially autocorrelated climate time series where red noise is a concern.
